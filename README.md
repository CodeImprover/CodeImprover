## [CodeImprover is a set of tools to measure source code quality]( https://codeimprover.com)

CodeImprover reads the source code pushed to GitHub and uses different kinds of algorithms to calculate metrics or perform checks on code quality. Code quality is in this context a measure of the developerâ€™s ability to fix system errors, adjust features, and expand the system over time in a fast and reliable way without introducing errors. In other words - code quality is maintainability.  
Get an overview of CodeImprover [here](https://codeimprover.com/whyandhow/how-it-works-illustrated/) or start using the [CodeImprover GitHub app now](https://github.com/marketplace?query=CodeImprover)

## The CodeImprover Community
We encourage you to become part of the CodeImprover community here on GitHub. The best way is to use the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/CodeImprover/CodeImprover/discussions).

## CodeImprover Metrics GitHub App
The GitHub App analyzes every commit and every pull request and calculates the code quality [Observation Score and Rating](https://codeimprover.com/whyandhow/key-concept-observation-scores-ratings/).  
Start using it [now](https://github.com/marketplace?query=CodeImprover)

## CodeImprover Duplication GitHub App
The GitHub app checks if the committed code contains a sequence of text that already exists anywhere in the repo. 
The behavior of the app is extremely flexible and can be configured  in the [codeimprover.yaml configuration file](https://codeimprover.com/techref/codeimprover-config/). 

**Configuration of duplication detection depends on programming language**  
You probably want to change the configuration file (codeimprover.yaml) to suit your programming language. 
We encourage you to contribute your codeimprover.yaml. 

## CodeImprover Web Portal
The CodeImprover Web Portal provides code quality information across developers on a timeline. It also offers status analyzes of complete branches. 
Last but not least, it offers data about Programmers' code coverage, making it possible to evaluate how well the current staff of programmers know the codebase.  
The CodeImprover Web Portal is expected to ship in 2021.
